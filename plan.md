## Time

* 10 hours per week
* 5 hours (weekday), 5 hours (Sat-Sun)
  * 4 hours on topic, 1 hours on tools

    If this timing is over-ambitious do 7 hours study, 1 on tools.

At the end of each quarter you should have two new programs that demonstrate the topics you've learned. Use the alternate quarter to write a new program, expand or improve on existing. Be sure to end up with 7-8 new programs though.

Programs should be non-trivial, be useful and functional, and deployed to either a publically accessible website or application repository, along with the code in Github.

Examples: Website application (not just a static page), Desktop application (UWP and Electron). Create and publish an npm, yarn, nuget package and a yeoman generator (Only one of these can count as 1 of 8 applications and it should be non-trivial).

Be thinking about creating the applications as you learn the language elements. Move beyond the basics and quickstart tutorials. Challenge yourself!

Use 2 of the 10 hours to study tools. Learn new shortcut keys, install and learn new extensions, try out git commands you haven't used before. Explore features of npm, yarn, nuget and yeoman generators. Learn new features of Visual Studio 2017. No more than 1 hour of this time per week should be used for passive study, i.e. videos, articles, blogs, etc. Use Stack Overflow to read up and answer questions.

Document what you learn, ideally as you go but afterwards too. This shouldn't count as time spent studying and creating.
